# Lightweight Terminal Framework
### Written by Peter Philips, 2019

This framework is meant as a teaching tool to learn object oriented programming with Ruby. It provides a basic Model-Controller pattern that slightly resembles Ruby on Rails. It also comes with a skeleton MenuController that is used to present a menu of options to the user at the terminal. 

It is up to the developer to further expand on the controllers and thus menu of options that are available. 

## Get Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Start application with `ruby application.rb`
3. Implement more controllers in the controllers/ directory and add access to them by adding to the MENU_CHOICES constant in MenuController.rb

## Running tests
+ `ruby test.rb`
